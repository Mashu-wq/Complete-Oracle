# Beginner Level
## 1. Create A Table
Let's create a simple table called employees with the following columns:

  - employee_id: Number

  - first_name: VARCHAR2(50)

  - last_name: VARCHAR2(50)

  - department: VARCHAR2(50)

  - salary: Number

```
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50),
    last_name VARCHAR2(50),
    department VARCHAR2(50),
    salary NUMBER
);
```
## 2.Insert Data into the table
Next, let's insert some sample data into the employees table:
```
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary) 
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'Sales', 60000);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary) 
VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'HR', 50000);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary) 
VALUES (3, 'Mike', 'Johnson', 'IT', 75000);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary) 
VALUES (4, 'Emily', 'Davis', 'Sales', 62000);

INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary) 
VALUES (5, 'Michael', 'Brown', 'IT', 68000);
```
## Basic Data Types and Functions
### 1. Common Data Types
- VARCHAR2(A variable-length string data type used to store alphanumeric data);

  Syntax: VARCHAR2(size)
  ```
  first_name VARCHAR2(50);
  ```
  This defines a column first_name that can store up to 50 characters.
- NUMBER (A numeric data type used to store both integers and floating-point numbers)

  Syntax: NUMBER(precision, scale)

  precision: The total number of digits.

  scale: The number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
  ```
  salary NUMBER(8, 2);
  ```
  This defines a salary column that can store up to 8 digits, with 2 digits after the decimal point.
- DATE ( A date data type used to store date and time information)
  ```
  hire_date DATE;
  ```
  This defines a hire_date column to store date values (including time, by default).
### 2.String Functions
- CONCAT(Concatenates (joins) two strings together)

  Syntax: CONCAT(string1, string2)
  ```
  SELECT CONCAT(first_name, last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
  ```
  This concatenates first_name and last_name into a single string full_name.
- SUBSTR(Extracts a substring from a string)

  Syntax: SUBSTR(string, start_position, length)

  start_position: The position where the substring starts.

  length: The number of characters to extract.

  ```
  SELECT SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 3) AS short_name FROM employees;
  ```
  This extracts the first three characters from first_name.
- LENGTH(Returns the length of a string)

  Syntax: LENGTH(string)
  ```
  SELECT LENGTH(last_name) AS name_length FROM employees;
  ```
  This returns the length of the last_name string.
  



## SELECT Statements: Retrieving Data from a Single Table
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables. Hereâ€™s an example:
```
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM table_name;
```
```
SELECT first_name, last_name, email
FROM employees;

```
This query retrieves the first_name, last_name, and email columns from the employees table.

## Filtering Data Using WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records that meet certain conditions.
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

```
```
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales';

```
This query retrieves the first_name and last_name of employees who work in the Sales department.

## Sorting Data Using ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set by one or more columns.
```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];

```
```
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;

```
This query retrieves the first_name, last_name, and salary columns from the employees table and sorts the results by salary in descending order.

## Using DISTINCT to Eliminate Duplicates
The DISTINCT keyword is used to remove duplicate records from the result set.
```
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2
FROM table_name;

```
```
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```
